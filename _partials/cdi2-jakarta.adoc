== CDI 2.0 (Jakarta)

CDI 2.0 is part of move of Java EE 8 to Jakarta EE 8. The API and specification remain semantically the same,
but references to Java EE and associated technologies have been updated
to use Jakarta EE and the related updated names.

The source repositories have moved under the Eclipse EE4J organization
to the following repositories:

* https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cdi[CDI Api and Spec]
* https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cdi-tck[CDI TCK]
