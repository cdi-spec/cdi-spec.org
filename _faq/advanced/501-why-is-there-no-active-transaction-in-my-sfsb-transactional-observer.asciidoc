= Why is there no active transaction in my SFSB transactional observer?
Nicklas Karlsson

Sometimes it's useful to have an +AFTER_SUCCESS+ transactional observer. For example you could update a list when an entity is persisted. However, if you use:

[source,java]
----
public void userAdded(@Observes(during=TransactionPhase.AFTER_SUCCESS) @Added User user)
{
  // access a persistence context and refresh the user list
}
----

in a stateful session bean, you will get ''transaction is not active''. You need to use +REQUEIRES_NEW+ by adding +@TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRES_NEW)+ to the bean or the to the method.
