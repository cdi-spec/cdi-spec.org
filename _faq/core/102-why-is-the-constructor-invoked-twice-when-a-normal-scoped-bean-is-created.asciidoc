= Why is the constructor invoked twice when a normal scoped bean is created?
Dan Allen

For every normal-scoped bean there is a proxy, and you are seeing the instantiation of two objects: one is the actual bean instance, the other one is the proxy. Both likely invoke the default constructor.

It's generally considered a bad idea to do initialization in class construction code. Instead, when using managed beans (objects managed by the Java EE container) you should perform initialization in a `@PostConstruct` or `@Inject` annotated method.

@SessionScoped
public class SampleBean {
   private Map x;

   @PostConstruct
   protected void init() {
      x = new ConcurrentHashMap();
   }
