= Can I share information between observers in a CDI extension?
Dan Allen

In other words, 'is the instance of my extension contextual and what is its scope?'

[quote, CDI Expert Group, Section 11.5 CDI Specification]
____
The container instantiates a single instance of each extension at the beginning of the application initialization process and maintains a reference to it until the application shuts down. The container delivers event notifications to this instance by calling its observer methods.
____

Speaking in code, the following assertion will be true (because there is always at least one bean):

[source,java]
----
public class TestExtension implements Extension {
    private List<Bean> beans = new ArrayList<Bean>();

    public void onProcessBean(@Observes ProcessBean e) {
        beans.add(e.getBean());
    }

    public void afterBeanDiscovery(@Observes AfterBeanDiscovery e) {
        assert beans.size() > 0;
    }
}
----

The possibilities of what you can do with extensions are limitless.
