= Why does my normal scoped bean not get instantiated immediately?
Pete Muir

A CDI implementation may choose to lazily instantiate a normal scoped bean. If you inject a shorter-lived bean into a longer-lived bean (e.g. session scoped into application scoped) then there is no obvious bean to instantiate at this point - depending on the active session for the thread a different bean instance will be injected.
