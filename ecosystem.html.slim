    'Because CDI goes well beyond standard Java EE, you'll find on this page resources of the CDI open source ecosystem. These are project or frameworks based on CDI to add high level features to your project
     or tools to help you develop your own CDI integration or framework.
     If you think a tool or framework is missing here. Feel free to contribute to this page, send a tweet to
